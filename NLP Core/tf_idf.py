#TF = Term frequency
#IDF = Inverse Document Frequency

#TF = (Number of occurences of a word in a document)/(Number of words in that document)
#IDF = log((Number of documents)/(Number of documents containing word))

#to decide what are the words that are taken into account, follow the bow model and find the
